# validator-security
A collaborative document for good practice with validator security. The hope is that the community will come together and improve this document by sharing knowledge and experience. At the moment it shouldn't be considered anywhere near complete, but simply a work in progress.

This repo aims to provide generic security recommendations for validators on any network, but also to contain specific details on the main chains of interest to the community.

Some of the key concerns in managing validator security:

* Physical Security
* Operational Security
* Device Security
* Software Security
* Consensus Security
* Key Management Security

Each of the above will be explored in their own document within this repo.
