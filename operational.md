## overview
Probably the least liked aspect of security: how to manage security in practise. Proper considerations for the management of security must go deeper than "just encrypt it". Encryption is a protection mechanism that gives no guarantee that humans will adequately manage the data or the keys. As with everything in this repo, we shouldn't reinvent the wheel where good literature already exists. While literature can help to bridge a knowledge gap, it won't bridge the experience that's of a higher importance when it comes to operational security.
